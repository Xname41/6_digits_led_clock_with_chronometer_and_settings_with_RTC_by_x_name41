The clock - stopwatch consists of a 6-digit display with hours, minutes and seconds and also three buttons SET, plus +, minus -. By holding down the SET button, the clock setting mode is entered, first the hours start flashing, which means that they can be set with plus or minus, by holding down the plus or minus button, automatic counting up or down begins, by next short pressing the SET button, the minutes start flashing, which means that they can be set using plus and minus in a similar way as the hours, and finally by next pressing the SET button, the seconds start flashing, which means that they can also be set in a similar way. By next short pressing the SET button, the clock setting mode is exited and the new set time is confirmed. The stopwatch mode is entered by short pressing the SET button, it displays minutes, seconds and milliseconds in a two-digit version. The plus button starts and stops the count, and the minus button resets it, if we exit the stopwatch mode when the stopwatch is not reset by the minus button, it will remain in this state until we manually reset it by the minus button in stopwatch mode, this means that it remembers the last displayed value even in clock mode

I intentionally left the scan frequency around 50 hertz so that the flicker effect can be seen
